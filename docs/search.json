I pursue research questions related to market fragmentation, high frequency trading and big data in financial applications. My research is thus anchored in the intersection of market microstructure, asset pricing and financial econometrics.\nI am also co-author of the books Tidy Finance with R and Tidy Finance with Python, written with my colleagues Christoph Frey, Christoph Scheuch and Patrick Weiss.\n\n\n\n\nWork in progress\nLiquidity and Price Informativeness in Blockchain-Based Markets\nThe DeFi Dilemma (with Nikolaus Hautsch and Aron Bodisz)\nMarket responses to a VIX impulse (with Nikolaus Hautsch and Albert J. Menkveld)\nUncertainty everywhere (with Patrick Weiss, Gregor Kastner, and Luis Gruber)\n\n\nPublications\nLarge Scale Portfolio Optimization under Transaction Costs and Model Uncertainty (Journal of Econometrics, 212 (1), 221-240)  Joint work with Nikolaus Hautsch\n\nWe theoretically and empirically study portfolio optimization under transaction costs and establish a link between turnover penalization and covariance shrinkage with the penalization governed by transaction costs. We show how the ex ante incorporation of transaction costs shifts optimal portfolios towards regularized versions of efficient allocations. The regulatory effect of transaction costs is studied in an econometric setting incorporating parameter uncertainty and optimally combining predictive distributions resulting from high-frequency and low-frequency data. In an extensive empirical study, we illustrate that turnover penalization is more effective than commonly employed shrinkage methods and is crucial in order to construct empirically well-performing portfolios.\n\nBuilding Trust Takes Time: Limits to Arbitrage for Blockchain-Based Assets (Review of Finance (2024), 28 (4), 1345–1381, Dataset, Code)  Joint work with Nikolaus Hautsch and Christoph Scheuch\n\nA blockchain replaces central counterparties with time-consuming consensus protocols to record the transfer of ownership. This settlement latency slows cross-exchange trading, exposing arbitrageurs to price risk. Off-chain settlement, instead, exposes arbitrageurs to costly default risk. We show with Bitcoin network and order book data that cross-exchange price differences coincide with periods of high settlement latency, asset flows chase arbitrage opportunities, and price differences across exchanges with low default risk are smaller. Blockchain-based trading thus faces a dilemma: Reliable consensus protocols require time-consuming settlement latency, leading to arbitrage limits. Circumventing such arbitrage costs is possible only by reinstalling trusted intermediation, which mitigates default risk.\n\nIntegrating Factor Models (The Journal of Finance (2023), 78, 1593-1646)  Joint work with Doron Avramov, Si Cheng, and Lior Metzker\n\nThis paper develops a comprehensive framework to address uncertainty about the correct factor model. Asset pricing inferences draw on a composite model that integrates over competing factor models weighted by posterior probabilities. Evidence shows that unconditional models record zero probabilities, and post-earnings announcement drift, quality-minus-junk, and intermediary capital are incremental factors in conditional asset pricing. The integrated model tilts away from the subsequently underperforming factors, and delivers stable and admissible strategies. Model uncertainty makes equities appear considerably riskier, while model disagreement about expected returns spikes during crash episodes. Disagreement spans all return components involving mispricing, factor loadings, and risk premia.\n\nNon-standard Errors (The Journal of Finance (2024), 79 (3), p. 2339 - 2390) Joint work with Albert J. Menkveld and 341 co-authors\n\nIn statistics, samples are drawn from a population in a data-generating process (DGP). Standard errors measure the uncertainty in estimates of population parameters. In science, evidence is generated to test hypotheses in an evidence-generating process (EGP). We claim that EGP variation across researchers adds uncertainty: Non-standard errors (NSEs). We study NSEs by letting 164 teams test the same hypotheses on the same data. NSEs turn out to be sizable, but smaller for better reproducible or higher rated research. Adding peer-review stages reduces NSEs. We further find that this type of uncertainty is underestimated by participants.\n\nTidy Finance with R (Chapman and Hall/CRC, 2023)  Joint work with Christoph Scheuch, Patrick Weiss\nTidy Finance with Python (Chapman and Hall/CRC, 2024)  Joint work with Christoph Scheuch, Patrick Weiss, and Christoph Frey\n\n\nTeaching\nImportant: If you would like me to supervise your Master thesis at KU, do not hesitate to reach out to me after you read the information here"

    "text": "I regularly supervise empirical bachelor projects or master thesis in Finance on the following topics: Machine Learning Applications in Asset Pricing, Optimal Portfolio Choice problems or Microstructure of Decentralized Exchanges.\nDo you share my enthusiasm about any of these fields? Excellent, let us get in touch!\nIf you would like me to supervise your thesis, do not hesitate to reach out to me after you read the information below. To make the supervision process as smooth as possible for you, I follow the following general structure and enforce few rules:\n\nBefore we get started: Drop me a mail with a maximum 1-page description of your proposed topic. You should state a first research question and a reference to one (not more, not less!) published academic journal – which you are excited about and which is closest and most relevant for your own project (preferably from one of the top 3 finance journals: The Journal of Finance, Review of Financial Studies or Journal of Financial Economics). Provide a brief outline how you want to study the question, if you already have access to required data and highlight any problems that could arise along the way – the earlier we discuss potential problems, the easier the upcoming months will become.\nIf I do have supervision capacities, I will provide you structured feedback on your desired project such that you can start as smooth as possible. You can use my feedback to update your project description and to generate a preliminary roadmap (which indicates precise dates on which you plan to finish the individual steps). This roadmap is part of the supervision contract.\nDuring the semester: I leave it as your responsibility to reach out by mail when you feel that a meeting is most meaningful – it is natural that sometime there are many important changes, sometimes you will just need time for yourself to work on the project. I do not enforce a strict timeline of meetings but rather let you sign up for meetings (up to 4 for Master students, up to 2 for Bachelor students) via mail – let me know at least 8 working days in advance that you want to meet.\nBefore a supervision meeting: I enforce a clear structure for the supervision meetings, which requires self-assessment on an ongoing basis. Latest 48 hours before the supervision meetings you will hand in your current manuscript and a self-assessment (max 1 page) on what you think are your most relevant questions (max. 3) and your own perception of the status, including an updated version of your intended timeline. These notes are your reflections on where you are in the process, what you feel comfortable about, where you are in doubt. I will base my supervision on these comments. Note: Without such a document and the manuscript as preparation in due time, I will cancel the meeting without replacement as I will not be able to give you high-level feedback without appropriate preparation material.\nDuring the supervision meeting: I will read your documents beforehand and provide feedback regarding my general assessment, the specific questions you highlighted in your preparation and my suggestions regarding the most critical tasks going forward. If necessary, you will receive a mail with my annotations on your manuscript after the meeting such that we do not have to waste time discussing on grammar, typos or formatting issues during the meeting.\nLatest 48 hours after the meeting: Send me an updated roadmap – I will sign it off and you are ready to proceed.\n\nI look forward to hear about your definitely exciting research project from you as soon as possible!"
